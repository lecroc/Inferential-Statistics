## Part 1: Data

The data comes from the General Social Surveys conducted by the National Opinion Research Center using a standard questionaire.  Surveys were conducted in 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016.  A total of 62466 interviews have been conducted, with the median length of the interview being about one and one-half hours.  

Surveys from 1972 through 2004 were independently drawn samples of English-speaking persons 18 years of age or over, living in non-institutional arrangements within the United States. Starting in 2006 Spanish-speakers were added to the target population. 

Until 2000, the survey was administered in a paper-and-pencil format, but starting in 2002, the GSS was conducted by computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI).

### Scope of Inference:

The data include a large number of randomly drawn responses, so it is generalizable to the target population of persons 18 years old or older living in non-institutional arrangements within the United States. 

This study is observational without random assignment, and therefore no causal relationships can be inferred from this data.  The length of the study might be a concern in that respondents may become fatigued with such a long questionaire and begin to give less accurate responses.

## Part 2: Research question

I'm interested in racial diversity issues particularly related to income inequality.  I'm curious to see if certain regions of the United States might correlate with higher incomes for people of color.  Therefore, my research question is:

Does the constant annual income (dollars adjusted for inflation) of respondents who self-idenfify as black differ significantly by region?

## Part 3: Exploratory data analysis

To get the dataset I need to answer my research question I will reduce the data to the constant incomes reported by self-identified black respondents in all nine regions.  I'll then remove any records with missing data and look at the counts by region to make sure I have enough data from each region.

```{r}

# creat my data

mydata<-gss %>%
  select(race, coninc, region) %>%
  filter(race != "Other" & race !="White") %>%
  select(region, coninc)

# get rid of N/As

completes<-complete.cases(mydata)
mydata<-mydata[completes,]

#  Check counts of respondents by region

mydatasum<-mydata %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(n=n())

head(mydatasum, 9)

```

I'll now organize a table of summary statistics:

```{r}

sum1<- mydata %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(Q1=quantile(coninc, .25), Mean=mean(coninc), Median=median(coninc),
            Q3=quantile(coninc, .75), IQR=IQR(coninc), StDev=sd(coninc)) %>%
  mutate(Skew=ifelse(Mean>Median, "Right", "Left"))

head(sum1, 9)
```

The summary statistics show that the constant income data is right skewed for all regions.  In addition, there is a fair amount of variability in the center and spread of the distributions.  The box plot below helps illustrate these characteristics:


```{r}
p1<-ggplot(mydata, aes(x=factor(region), y=coninc, fill=factor(region)))+
  geom_boxplot()+ggtitle("Constant Income by Region")+
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60,hjust = 1))+
  xlab("Region")+ylab("Constant Annual Income")
p1
```

Near-normality for the constant income distributions by region is a concern as it is a condition for an ANOVA analysis.  I will look at further examine this with the following qq plots:

![](plot1.png)

We can see that from these plots that the distributions are not normal.  To address this I will log transform the constant income data and then re-look at the summary statistics and normality using the log-transformed variable.

```{r}
# log transform

mydata$coninc<-log(mydata$coninc)

# EDA after log transform

sum2<- mydata %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(Q1=quantile(coninc, .25), Mean=mean(coninc), Median=median(coninc),
            Q3=quantile(coninc, .75), IQR=IQR(coninc), StDev=sd(coninc)) %>%
  mutate(Skew=ifelse(Mean>Median, "Right", "Left"))

head(sum2, 9)
```

The log transformation has flipped the skew from right to left in all but on region, and has tightened up the center and spread as well - as we can see from the box plot below:

```{r}

p2<-ggplot(mydata, aes(x=factor(region), y=coninc, fill=factor(region)))+
  geom_boxplot()+ggtitle("Natural Log of Constant Income by Region")+
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60,hjust = 1))+
  xlab("Region")+ylab("Log of Constant Annual Income")

p2

```

In addition, the log transformed distribution is much more normal as evidenced by these plots:
